As you know, we can\\'t find much stock as players due to the GPU demand of mining friends. While researching to buy a GPU for a gaming computer, I found the RX 6700 XT Sapphire Pulse model GPU on Amazon Japan at a more affordable price than the sales price in my country. I opened an account to buy it on my own, but the payment transaction I made with a virtual credit card was not confirmed and there was a message in the \"my orders\" tab that the payment method should be reviewed.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen I talked to the customer service about the situation, they said that sometimes there may be such problems with some credit cards, it would be more convenient for me to buy a \"Gift Card\" and pay for the GPU with it. For this reason, I asked my mother to open an account at Amazon.co.jp, I explained the situation and told her that I will send her a \"Gift Card\", and she will order the GPU with the link that I sent her and she completed the order by paying the order amount by using a \"Gift Card\" I sent her. My mother ordered the GPU from her own account and made the payment with a gift Card. However, she said that the order was canceled instantly and when she tried to re-enter the account she could not log in.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSo I went to my mother and saw that when I try to log in to the account, it shows as \"suspended\" and asks for various documents. As such, we sent the requested documents and waited for 2-3 days. As a result of this process, we received an e-mail stating that the documents were reviewed and the account was completely closed. Then, through my mother\\'s e-mail, my mother\\'s residence, bank expenses, identity card, etc. We sent everything we had to prove that the account belongs to my mother, but after about 6-7 days, Amazon Japan did not give any response. In the last e-mail they sent, there was a message stating that they may not respond to this issue again (\"we may not reply further questions about this issue\"). Later, I sent an e-mail to get information about the subject from my own e-mail account, but I did not receive a response. I had a lot of communication with customer service officials in both Japanese (Google translate) and English, but all they said was that I can not be informed about the closure of my mother\\'s account and if it was closed it would not be opened again.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs this was the case, I was unable to use the Gift Card I sent, and because the account was closed, I requested that the \"gift Card\" or its amount be sent back to my account. However, they said that gift-Cards are not returnable, reusable, transferable to another account. In short, the money that it took me about 8 months to save is locked in a closed account and no refund is made to my own account. When I talked to my bank, they said that since I do not have a refundable purchase, I can fill out a spending objection form, but there is a 99% chance that it will not be positive. On this subject, Amazon America, Turkey etc. they say that I can only solve the problem with Amazon Japan\\'s customer service, but Amazon Japan has never left the door open for me under any circumstances.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI would be very happy if there is someone who has experienced this kind of situation before, who can share their experiences and make suggestions. It wasn\\'t a problem if the account was closed, but my money(\"$930\") was detained saying that it would not be refunded.

I have the most train of any sing employee in my building, did all of my department logistics paperwork, and do my own actual job if there was any time left. \\n\\nofficially my job was a t1 dock Havey labber but practical i was a\\n\\noutbound dock PA\\n\\nout bound dock PA\\n\\nproblem solver for 3 departments\\n\\nlesson for 5 different departments\\n\\ntraining ambassador for 2 departments\\n\\nsecondary labor for 6 departments \\n\\nsafety hazmat \\n\\nit guy\\n\\nyou know what i got for all that work on top of my pass pay nothing.\\n\\nI did it because someone had to I .never moved up because I would have had no control over what department they made me PA over and i was not willing to let all my work in vrets go to waste for the same pay and more responsibility. vendor returns need long time trained staff but if something want wrong or the impassable standards could not be met the first thing thy do is fire the t1 staff. i stayed to prevent that from happening the workload all most killed me in 2019 and early 2020. I will now have migraines and vertigo for the rest of my life. it looks like Amazon will not let me come back because i can't do the heavy labor anymore even tho i have not back a box in a yaer.\\n\\npersonal after 8 months of amazon dragging out my medical lave I hope the company crashes harder and faster than the hinenburg. drive people into an early grave, a company culture of arrogant saperority of t3 plus staff and shit low-level management is doing a great job of that if you ask me.\\n\\ndon't work for amazon it just a meat grinder\", \"Let me preface this question by saying I've ordered like 2 items from Amazon my entire life and I don't actually like shopping with them when I can get the same item quick in a store.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nDoes Amazon actually lie about what they expect from their employees upon hiring (ie quota, work hours, etc)?

As you know, we can\\'t find much stock as players due to the GPU demand of mining friends. While researching to buy a GPU for a gaming computer, I found the RX 6700 XT Sapphire Pulse model GPU on Amazon Japan at a more affordable price than the sales price in my country. I opened an account to buy it on my own, but the payment transaction I made with a virtual credit card was not confirmed and there was a message in the \"my orders\" tab that the payment method should be reviewed.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen I talked to the customer service about the situation, they said that sometimes there may be such problems with some credit cards, it would be more convenient for me to buy a \"Gift Card\" and pay for the GPU with it. For this reason, I asked my mother to open an account at Amazon.co.jp, I explained the situation and told her that I will send her a \"Gift Card\", and she will order the GPU with the link that I sent her and she completed the order by paying the order amount by using a \"Gift Card\" I sent her. My mother ordered the GPU from her own account and made the payment with a gift Card. However, she said that the order was canceled instantly and when she tried to re-enter the account she could not log in.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSo I went to my mother and saw that when I try to log in to the account, it shows as \"suspended\" and asks for various documents. As such, we sent the requested documents and waited for 2-3 days. As a result of this process, we received an e-mail stating that the documents were reviewed and the account was completely closed. Then, through my mother\\'s e-mail, my mother\\'s residence, bank expenses, identity card, etc. We sent everything we had to prove that the account belongs to my mother, but after about 6-7 days, Amazon Japan did not give any response. In the last e-mail they sent, there was a message stating that they may not respond to this issue again (\"we may not reply further questions about this issue\"). Later, I sent an e-mail to get information about the subject from my own e-mail account, but I did not receive a response. I had a lot of communication with customer service officials in both Japanese (Google translate) and English, but all they said was that I can not be informed about the closure of my mother\\'s account and if it was closed it would not be opened again.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs this was the case, I was unable to use the Gift Card I sent, and because the account was closed, I requested that the \"gift Card\" or its amount be sent back to my account. However, they said that gift-Cards are not returnable, reusable, transferable to another account. In short, the money that it took me about 8 months to save is locked in a closed account and no refund is made to my own account. When I talked to my bank, they said that since I do not have a refundable purchase, I can fill out a spending objection form, but there is a 99% chance that it will not be positive. On this subject, Amazon America, Turkey etc. they say that I can only solve the problem with Amazon Japan\\'s customer service, but Amazon Japan has never left the door open for me under any circumstances.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI would be very happy if there is someone who has experienced this kind of situation before, who can share their experiences and make suggestions. It wasn\\'t a problem if the account was closed, but my money(\"$930\") was detained saying that it would not be refunded.

So it was never on it’s direct way to my house, but was immediately send back to the return warehouse by Amazon. Why did this happen and why does it keep happening??

I have never requested a refund for an item that I did not return. Not once. If I do return something, I always hand it to the UPS person and get a receipt, give it to the clerk at the Amazon location in Cleveland, OH, or most recently, place it in the Amazon locker.\\n\\nThis is the result of my conversation with Amazon today, because I returned an expensive camera that I bought from Amazon Warehouse. The camera was listed as \"like new, packaging damaged\".

Since it\\'s 9.15, I\\'m not going to bother with it until the morning.\\n\\nThe next morning, I get an email saying that the package was damaged and that it\\'s being returned. I am getting a bit livid, so I start chatting with a C/S agent and they have the audacity to tell me that the package arrived at the destination hub and that the tracking was incorrectly updated.\\n\\nI am just floored. At least with other companies, packages are scanned before being loaded onto a vehicle for delivery; I found it hard to believe that a damaged package arrived at its destination hub damaged, was NOT taken out of the system but instead had its tracking info \"incorrectly updated\", and then no one filled out some sort of damage notification until well after 9 PM.\\n\\nI honestly believe the driver didn\\'t want to deliver any more packages that day, took what was left back to the hub, and then told their supervisor or whatever that it was undelivered because it was damaged.\\n\\nI asked the C/S agent how the merchandise was damaged (it was a backpack and a wallet), and the only answer they would give me is that it was damaged in transit.\\n\\nOn top of that, they have the audacity to tell me to reorder? I didn\\'t even get anything from the conversation other than many variations of \"this is unexpected\" and \"we\\'re sorry to hear that\".\\n\\nI dislike how Amazon Logistics is the default carrier for my address. I fight C/S over them a few times a year because they will deliver to the wrong unit even though the delivery instructions specify which unit in a triplex is my unit (my fricken last name and unit number is on my mailbox, which is next to my front door). They do their whole apology and feedback song-and-dance script, and then the mis-deliveries stop for a while (a few months or so), but it always seems to happen again.', 'Has anyone found a way to get Amazon to fix the many books where \\'Look Inside\\' doesn\\'t work, please?\\n\\nLike [this book](https://smile.amazon.com/Scenes-Prehistoric-Life-Million-British/dp/1789544149/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=francis+pryor&qid=1628543283&sr=8-1)… \\'Sorry, there was a problem loading this page.\\'\\n\\nI\\'ve been trying to find someone at Amazon (chat, email, phone, even letters and fax; I also always report the error) who will take my bug report seriously.

My only options for returning the item was by shipping it or drop off via locker. I could not go to Kohl\\'s or Whole Foods (my normal method).  Ok. So, I dropped it off in a locker 4 days ago.  The status of my return still appears as if I haven\\'t dropped it off yet.   I never received any confirmation that I dropped it off, and there\\'s no tracking available to me.  \\n\\nSo, I spent 15 mins on a chat.  It took them 10 minutes of researching to be able to confirm that \"It does appear that it was received in the locker\".  But, they have no other updates.  Really?  That just seems crazy to me that Amazon provides so little visibility into the returns process.', \"I have items delivered to my office which go to a luxor locker OR the tenant services office.

I have about $700 worth of product that has been in return stages for over a month without a refund. I cannot get to anyone who can help. I call the customer service and they all say “give it 3-5 business days for the problem to resolve”. I escalate it to supervisors and they send me a form email about how Amazon is not responsible for timely delivery of product. I get with the return specialist team and they say they see some problems and will follow up…yet I never get a follow up. \\n\\nI am 5 days from my charge back window. I would hate to do this but I am ready to just charge back the full amount.', 'I’ll give this a shot.  I recently had to report a package that said it was delivered but didn’t arrive.  I have spent thousands on Amazon the last few years and have had to have one or two items replaced because they came defective but never had a package say it was delivered and then it actually not arrive.  I waited until the next day to see if it’s show up and it didn’t so I contacted the chat support.  \\n\\nThe item I purchased was on an Amazon payment plan and it was around $800.00.  I needed the item so I asked the associate if they could just send a replacement, they told me they couldn’t but they could refund me so I agreed to the refund and asked if I could be credited the difference in order to just order it again since the price jumped $180.00 and again they said they could do that.\\n\\nI then received a refund on my Amazon account for a movie I bought last week and actually received.  I immediately asked the associate about it and they seemed confused and so I specified the order number difference.  The associate said that refund was a mistake and assured me that the original item had been refunded but would show up in one to three hours.\\n\\nThe associate them abruptly ended the chat session and I received several emails within about twenty minutes about other items being refunded which I’d received.  Eventually the correct order was shown to be refunded but it was said to be refunded to my visa credit card, I used a debit card.  So I contacted support again and they confirmed for me that it was the correct card because I wasn’t sure since it was supposed to be a gift card so I could reorder the item.\\n\\nI then received an email today stating that they’d noticed I recently received a lot of refunds.  There was no threat of banning my account or anything but it annoyed me because when I started getting notifications of all these random refunds all I could think was the rep was just clicking one order after another refunding them and I actually worried that I’d be banned for it when I didn’t ask for all these refunds.  The worst part about it is that after he abruptly closed the chat I never received a chat transcript so I don’t even have proof that I tried to sort it out while still in chat.  \\n\\nAnyway today I saw my items monthly payments have been cancelled, I haven’t received any money in the bank and my bank said they didn’t see anything pending.  I figured since my items monthly payments was cancelled it would be safe to reorder the item because I need it desperately but now I have this ominous feeling over me about my account and how it may be on Amazon’s flagged radar because of something one of their employees did.  \\n\\nI figured I’d give it a few days to see if any refund showed up in the bank and after my reordered item arrives contact them to try and sort it out, I’m just afraid to try and do it because the last time I spoke to a rep they did that and caused the mess.  \\n\\nI should also mention that the day my package was “delivered” I had about four deliveries and when I asked my neighbors about if one had been delivered to their house because it does sometimes happen they said no but there was a weird guy walking up and down our road.  The only reason I mention that is because I had four out of five packages on my front porch.  \\n\\nCurrently I have the credit in my Amazon gift balance that was supplied to me for all the wrong refunds, I was wondering if anyone had any insight onto if my account is in trouble that maybe explaining this to another rep could help sort it out?', \"**Has the quality of goods sold through Amazon gone downhill in recent years?**\\n\\nI just got back from a few weeks in the US.  \\nWe don't really have Amazon in the country I'm based in. So I tend to keep a few wishlists open and order what I need when I'm over there.  \\nThis year's crop of orders seems to have been a particular disappointment. I've also noticed that a lot (/growing amount?) of what's being sold on Amazon seems to be de-branded Chinese merchandise -- which is the kind of stuff I can already get through platforms like Aliexpress and which I generally try to avoid.  \\nAmazon are fantastic about customer service and issuing refunds when stuff doesn't work. However, given the hassle involve in picking out products, returning stuff, and speaking to their CS ... I'd kinda rather just buy stuff that works.  \\nI've already encountered:  \\n\\\\- A backpack whose zippers broke after a few hours' of use  \\n\\\\- An audio mixer that just didn't work out of the box  \\n\\\\- Flip flops sent in a completely different color than what I ordered (black vs. brown). Amazon kindly offered a returnless refund because it was the last day of my trip and there were no UPSs open to return from but ... I'd rather rather just have the flip flops that I requested.  \\nI'm not sure whether this is a manifestation of Amazon not having time to properly vet suppliers; poor conditions at fulfillment centers encouraging underpair workers to be sloppy about selecting stock; or something else. But either way, it's been quite noticeable on this round of ordering in a way that wasn't the case before.  \\nMy bad luck / poor ordering?

       "[\"This patent contemplates lifting water to a great height in a tower by vaporizing the water into humidity using a simple mechanical atomizer. The fog is drawn up by the suction from blowing the dry air from the condenser at the top back down to the bottom in an outer pipe surrounding the inner central pipe that carries the fog up. The tower is closed, so the air moves in a loop.\\n\\nIn itself that's a pretty brilliant idea for moving water potentially more efficiently. If it can be more efficient, it would be useful to decrease the energy used in water towers or any kind of water pumping. Of course it shouldn't be possible to generate any net power by using the water pressure to generate electric, but that is what the patent office category alleged perpetua mobilia (F03G7/10) implies. I'm not sure when categories were added or why this was categorized as perpetual motion. That claim may have been made in the patent application but could not appear in the published patent, because that's a rule. It says the lift should be 250 feet (76 m) for good results generating power, and the fans and vaporizer combined should add up to a fraction of a horsepower (745 W). Unfortunately it doesn't give an example of how fast it moves water.\\n\\nI wouldn't believe that unless I saw it for myself, but maybe it could work in some ideal conditions? Looking up ballpark figures, the efficiency of electric pumps seems to vary from 45-90%. Fans are less efficient than pumps and air experiences more resistance than water, so it seems like it would be remarkable for a system using air to match the efficiency of normal pumps. It seems like it might need to use a more efficient air mover than the type of fan the figures depict to be very efficient. A centrifugal air mover occupying the entire space between the two pipes seems ideal.\\n\\nIf it can work, it seems like it could only work by harnessing some power from its environment. It might work by absorbing heat from outside the tower. And even then, it would still defy entropy as we understand it. If this can work, it may be by clever use of thermodynamics. Maybe the vaporization doesn't use heat, so it must absorb heat, and the condenser also absorbs heat. Even if our null hypothesis that it can't harness any net power is true, the concept might be useful for pumping water more efficiently. And it is still a form of pumped hydro power storage.\\n\\nTo explain the figures briefly, Fig. 1 shows the tower with lower water tank 2, water vaporizer 34, and central standpipe 10 that carries vapor up surrounded by the walls of the tower 1 that act as an outer pipe 11. Fig. 2 shows the condenser 10 and fans 35-36 at the top of the tower. The simple passive condenser is made of convex baffles that condense water on their concave sides. Water is collected in upper tank 12 to drive water turbine 4 to produce mechanical power that could drive a generator. Fig. 3 shows the vaporizer, which is a screen disk wheel 27 that rotates over a ring of water jets 23. Fig. 4 shows the screen disk wheel. It explains the rotating screen atomizes water by cutting across the jets at high speed. Fig. 5 shows the ring of water jets. The holes in the central standpipe prevent condensation within the pipe by jacketing the fog with a little dry air from the return. The fans pressurize the dry return air at the top of the tower while drawing a vacuum that raises the fog.\\n\\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US2265878\\n\\nGenerating power this way would make more sense with a mineshaft instead of a tower. Then heat would play a role in raising the fog and it would be low-power low-temperature form of geothermal power.\\n\\nBesides the power generating concept, the vaporizer in this patent should be a greener fog generator especially if this can be as efficient as it says. Fog machines are electric boilers that generate a relatively cool steam fog using heat, which uses a ton of power. The vaporizer in this patent makes fog with mechanical force and while it doesn't list figures, it's implied this method must use less energy. Fog machines use a solution of 10-20% glycerin to make the steam thicker/foggier, which this method would probably also need to replicate to be useful for that application, but this type of atomizer might not work well with that thicker solution. There are also industrial fog cannons that are used for dust suppression. They use air or water pressure to create a short-lived mist rather than a boiler, but this method could be more efficient than that too. They don't make nice looking fog. The fog from this vaporizer would probably need to have the largest particles separated out first to make stable fog that looks good like a fog machine makes.\\n\\nConsidering natural fog and clouds can be charged, electrostatics might make this invention work better. It could be designed to make use of earth's electrostatic field by virtue of the height of the tower especially if the exterior wall of the tower was made of an electrical insulator like fiberglass. Regardless of whether it was intended to do that, electrostatics might also be used to improve its efficiency. The fog could be charged—possibly by charging the screen disk or grounding the disk while the vaporizer is surrounded by a field from a charged surface bearing the opposite of the charge the fog will carry. The vapor should only have ions of one polarity so electrostatic repulsion helps lift it. The standpipe could be charged with the same polarity to reduce condensation if the pipe has a conductive surface, or if it has a dielectric surface, a terminal on the opposite side could carry the opposite charge with the same effect of repelling the vapor from the surface. The electrostatic gradient within the tower could be increased or reversed with terminals at the top and bottom of the tower. Those terminals could be isolated from the ions so no charge neutralization (current) occurs. Then electric force would do work without consuming power, which might make it clear how a process like this patent could potentially be an example of perpetual motion. Electric potential violates conservation of energy when it's used to do work without current. That is unfortunately never how we use it, but that possibility exists. It isn't just a thought experiment. To be clear, ionization (to charge the fog) consumes current/power, but electrostatic repulsion/attraction are free work to whatever extent they are not accompanied by neutralization.\\n\\nThis invention has no apparent direct connection to Tesla, but it does fit a few of his themes. The vaguest similarity is that the air flow through this tower is the same as the fluid flow in Tesla's 1913 fountain ([US1113716](https://patents.google.com/patent/US1113716)). More concretely, the vaporizer also bears a striking resemblance to something Tesla invented, Arthur Matthews's 1944 Tesla turbine gas engine ([US2411798](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2411798)). In that engine, water is sprayed on the disks of a Tesla turbine for cooling. And the most striking resemblance is the use of humidity/fog to generate power. Tesla often suggested harnessing the power in atmospheric vapor. He wanted to control the weather to make hydroelectric power perfectly reliable as well as to prevent droughts. He wanted to use his same towers that would do everything else he wanted to do (transmit wireless power, broadcast, telephony, navigation, etc.). Regardless of how feasible any of that sounds, this invention also harnesses fog to generate power. It's the same idea using a tower instead of the open environment. It could well have been inspired by Tesla if it was not his idea.\"]"

As you know, we can\\'t find much stock as players due to the GPU demand of mining friends. While researching to buy a GPU for a gaming computer, I found the RX 6700 XT Sapphire Pulse model GPU on Amazon Japan at a more affordable price than the sales price in my country. I opened an account to buy it on my own, but the payment transaction I made with a virtual credit card was not confirmed and there was a message in the \"my orders\" tab that the payment method should be reviewed.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen I talked to the customer service about the situation, they said that sometimes there may be such problems with some credit cards, it would be more convenient for me to buy a \"Gift Card\" and pay for the GPU with it. For this reason, I asked my mother to open an account at Amazon.co.jp, I explained the situation and told her that I will send her a \"Gift Card\", and she will order the GPU with the link that I sent her and she completed the order by paying the order amount by using a \"Gift Card\" I sent her. My mother ordered the GPU from her own account and made the payment with a gift Card. However, she said that the order was canceled instantly and when she tried to re-enter the account she could not log in.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSo I went to my mother and saw that when I try to log in to the account, it shows as \"suspended\" and asks for various documents. As such, we sent the requested documents and waited for 2-3 days. As a result of this process, we received an e-mail stating that the documents were reviewed and the account was completely closed. Then, through my mother\\'s e-mail, my mother\\'s residence, bank expenses, identity card, etc. We sent everything we had to prove that the account belongs to my mother, but after about 6-7 days, Amazon Japan did not give any response. In the last e-mail they sent, there was a message stating that they may not respond to this issue again (\"we may not reply further questions about this issue\"). Later, I sent an e-mail to get information about the subject from my own e-mail account, but I did not receive a response. I had a lot of communication with customer service officials in both Japanese (Google translate) and English, but all they said was that I can not be informed about the closure of my mother\\'s account and if it was closed it would not be opened again.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs this was the case, I was unable to use the Gift Card I sent, and because the account was closed, I requested that the \"gift Card\" or its amount be sent back to my account. However, they said that gift-Cards are not returnable, reusable, transferable to another account. In short, the money that it took me about 8 months to save is locked in a closed account and no refund is made to my own account. When I talked to my bank, they said that since I do not have a refundable purchase, I can fill out a spending objection form, but there is a 99% chance that it will not be positive. On this subject, Amazon America, Turkey etc. they say that I can only solve the problem with Amazon Japan\\'s customer service, but Amazon Japan has never left the door open for me under any circumstances.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI would be very happy if there is someone who has experienced this kind of situation before, who can share their experiences and make suggestions. It wasn\\'t a problem if the account was closed, but my money(\"$930\") was detained saying that it would not be refunded.

As you know, we can\\'t find much stock as players due to the GPU demand of mining friends. While researching to buy a GPU for a gaming computer, I found the RX 6700 XT Sapphire Pulse model GPU on Amazon Japan at a more affordable price than the sales price in my country. I opened an account to buy it on my own, but the payment transaction I made with a virtual credit card was not confirmed and there was a message in the \"my orders\" tab that the payment method should be reviewed.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen I talked to the customer service about the situation, they said that sometimes there may be such problems with some credit cards, it would be more convenient for me to buy a \"Gift Card\" and pay for the GPU with it. For this reason, I asked my mother to open an account at Amazon.co.jp, I explained the situation and told her that I will send her a \"Gift Card\", and she will order the GPU with the link that I sent her and she completed the order by paying the order amount by using a \"Gift Card\" I sent her. My mother ordered the GPU from her own account and made the payment with a gift Card. However, she said that the order was canceled instantly and when she tried to re-enter the account she could not log in.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSo I went to my mother and saw that when I try to log in to the account, it shows as \"suspended\" and asks for various documents. As such, we sent the requested documents and waited for 2-3 days. As a result of this process, we received an e-mail stating that the documents were reviewed and the account was completely closed. Then, through my mother\\'s e-mail, my mother\\'s residence, bank expenses, identity card, etc. We sent everything we had to prove that the account belongs to my mother, but after about 6-7 days, Amazon Japan did not give any response. In the last e-mail they sent, there was a message stating that they may not respond to this issue again (\"we may not reply further questions about this issue\"). Later, I sent an e-mail to get information about the subject from my own e-mail account, but I did not receive a response. I had a lot of communication with customer service officials in both Japanese (Google translate) and English, but all they said was that I can not be informed about the closure of my mother\\'s account and if it was closed it would not be opened again.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs this was the case, I was unable to use the Gift Card I sent, and because the account was closed, I requested that the \"gift Card\" or its amount be sent back to my account. However, they said that gift-Cards are not returnable, reusable, transferable to another account. In short, the money that it took me about 8 months to save is locked in a closed account and no refund is made to my own account. When I talked to my bank, they said that since I do not have a refundable purchase, I can fill out a spending objection form, but there is a 99% chance that it will not be positive. On this subject, Amazon America, Turkey etc. they say that I can only solve the problem with Amazon Japan\\'s customer service, but Amazon Japan has never left the door open for me under any circumstances.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI would be very happy if there is someone who has experienced this kind of situation before, who can share their experiences and make suggestions.

There was no threat of banning my account or anything but it annoyed me because when I started getting notifications of all these random refunds all I could think was the rep was just clicking one order after another refunding them and I actually worried that I’d be banned for it when I didn’t ask for all these refunds.  The worst part about it is that after he abruptly closed the chat I never received a chat transcript so I don’t even have proof that I tried to sort it out while still in chat.  \\n\\nAnyway today I saw my items monthly payments have been cancelled, I haven’t received any money in the bank and my bank said they didn’t see anything pending.  I figured since my items monthly payments was cancelled it would be safe to reorder the item because I need it desperately but now I have this ominous feeling over me about my account and how it may be on Amazon’s flagged radar because of something one of their employees did.  \\n\\nI figured I’d give it a few days to see if any refund showed up in the bank and after my reordered item arrives contact them to try and sort it out, I’m just afraid to try and do it because the last time I spoke to a rep they did that and caused the mess.  \\n\\nI should also mention that the day my package was “delivered” I had about four deliveries and when I asked my neighbors about if one had been delivered to their house because it does sometimes happen they said no but there was a weird guy walking up and down our road.  The only reason I mention that is because I had four out of five packages on my front porch.  \\n\\nCurrently I have the credit in my Amazon gift balance that was supplied to me for all the wrong refunds, I was wondering if anyone had any insight onto if my account is in trouble that maybe explaining this to another rep could help sort it out?', \"**Has the quality of goods sold through Amazon gone downhill in recent years?**\\n\\nI just got back from a few weeks in the US.  \\nWe don't really have Amazon in the country I'm based in. So I tend to keep a few wishlists open and order what I need when I'm over there.  \\nThis year's crop of orders seems to have been a particular disappointment.

As you know, we can\\'t find much stock as players due to the GPU demand of mining friends. While researching to buy a GPU for a gaming computer, I found the RX 6700 XT Sapphire Pulse model GPU on Amazon Japan at a more affordable price than the sales price in my country. I opened an account to buy it on my own, but the payment transaction I made with a virtual credit card was not confirmed and there was a message in the \"my orders\" tab that the payment method should be reviewed.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen I talked to the customer service about the situation, they said that sometimes there may be such problems with some credit cards, it would be more convenient for me to buy a \"Gift Card\" and pay for the GPU with it. For this reason, I asked my mother to open an account at Amazon.co.jp, I explained the situation and told her that I will send her a \"Gift Card\", and she will order the GPU with the link that I sent her and she completed the order by paying the order amount by using a \"Gift Card\" I sent her. My mother ordered the GPU from her own account and made the payment with a gift Card. However, she said that the order was canceled instantly and when she tried to re-enter the account she could not log in.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSo I went to my mother and saw that when I try to log in to the account, it shows as \"suspended\" and asks for various documents. As such, we sent the requested documents and waited for 2-3 days. As a result of this process, we received an e-mail stating that the documents were reviewed and the account was completely closed. Then, through my mother\\'s e-mail, my mother\\'s residence, bank expenses, identity card, etc. We sent everything we had to prove that the account belongs to my mother, but after about 6-7 days, Amazon Japan did not give any response. In the last e-mail they sent, there was a message stating that they may not respond to this issue again (\"we may not reply further questions about this issue\"). Later, I sent an e-mail to get information about the subject from my own e-mail account, but I did not receive a response. I had a lot of communication with customer service officials in both Japanese (Google translate) and English, but all they said was that I can not be informed about the closure of my mother\\'s account and if it was closed it would not be opened again.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs this was the case, I was unable to use the Gift Card I sent, and because the account was closed, I requested that the \"gift Card\" or its amount be sent back to my account. However, they said that gift-Cards are not returnable, reusable, transferable to another account. In short, the money that it took me about 8 months to save is locked in a closed account and no refund is made to my own account. When I talked to my bank, they said that since I do not have a refundable purchase, I can fill out a spending objection form, but there is a 99% chance that it will not be positive. On this subject, Amazon America, Turkey etc. they say that I can only solve the problem with Amazon Japan\\'s customer service, but Amazon Japan has never left the door open for me under any circumstances.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI would be very happy if there is someone who has experienced this kind of situation before, who can share their experiences and make suggestions. It wasn\\'t a problem if the account was closed, but my money(\"$930\") was detained saying that it would not be refunded.

As you know, we can\\'t find much stock as players due to the GPU demand of mining friends. While researching to buy a GPU for a gaming computer, I found the RX 6700 XT Sapphire Pulse model GPU on Amazon Japan at a more affordable price than the sales price in my country. I opened an account to buy it on my own, but the payment transaction I made with a virtual credit card was not confirmed and there was a message in the \"my orders\" tab that the payment method should be reviewed.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nWhen I talked to the customer service about the situation, they said that sometimes there may be such problems with some credit cards, it would be more convenient for me to buy a \"Gift Card\" and pay for the GPU with it. For this reason, I asked my mother to open an account at Amazon.co.jp, I explained the situation and told her that I will send her a \"Gift Card\", and she will order the GPU with the link that I sent her and she completed the order by paying the order amount by using a \"Gift Card\" I sent her. My mother ordered the GPU from her own account and made the payment with a gift Card. However, she said that the order was canceled instantly and when she tried to re-enter the account she could not log in.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSo I went to my mother and saw that when I try to log in to the account, it shows as \"suspended\" and asks for various documents. As such, we sent the requested documents and waited for 2-3 days. As a result of this process, we received an e-mail stating that the documents were reviewed and the account was completely closed. Then, through my mother\\'s e-mail, my mother\\'s residence, bank expenses, identity card, etc. We sent everything we had to prove that the account belongs to my mother, but after about 6-7 days, Amazon Japan did not give any response. In the last e-mail they sent, there was a message stating that they may not respond to this issue again (\"we may not reply further questions about this issue\"). Later, I sent an e-mail to get information about the subject from my own e-mail account, but I did not receive a response. I had a lot of communication with customer service officials in both Japanese (Google translate) and English, but all they said was that I can not be informed about the closure of my mother\\'s account and if it was closed it would not be opened again.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs this was the case, I was unable to use the Gift Card I sent, and because the account was closed, I requested that the \"gift Card\" or its amount be sent back to my account. However, they said that gift-Cards are not returnable, reusable, transferable to another account. In short, the money that it took me about 8 months to save is locked in a closed account and no refund is made to my own account. When I talked to my bank, they said that since I do not have a refundable purchase, I can fill out a spending objection form, but there is a 99% chance that it will not be positive. On this subject, Amazon America, Turkey etc. they say that I can only solve the problem with Amazon Japan\\'s customer service, but Amazon Japan has never left the door open for me under any circumstances.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI would be very happy if there is someone who has experienced this kind of situation before, who can share their experiences and make suggestions.
